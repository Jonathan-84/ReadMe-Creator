  ### Using this application you can quickly format and create the ReadMe for your project. All it takes is the answering of a few questions, and you are ready to go back to application creating- not documentation.

  ## Installation 
  Fork the repository (see the link below). Clone it to your computer. Open the files in your preferred coding application. Install the Inquirer npm package. Now you are ready to use it.  

  ## Usage 
  In order to use the application, make sure that you have the Inquirer npm package installed. Using your preferred coding application’s (VS Code in my case) terminal, confirm that you are in the Develop folder. Once in the Develop folder, type “node index” and answer the questions. After answering all of the questions, your new ReadMe file will be created.
